# FindSurface for Windows

**Curv*Surf* FindSurfaceâ„¢**

## Overview

This library is the implementation of the **FindSurface** library for **Windows (C/C++).**

The C++ header file (`.hpp`) provided with the library contains an example wrapper of FindSurface to help you to use FindSurface in an OOP style. You may write your own wrapper in order to use more advanced features of the latest version of C++, or to use FindSurface in lower versions of C++, if you need. The current header is written for C++14.

> **NOTE**: This library provides its functionality for non-commercial purposes. It is internally limited to process input point clouds of **100k points or less**. For commercial uses or use cases that require more than 100k points, please contact to support@curvsurf.com.
